$$
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{N{\sum}xy - ({\sum}x)({\sum}y)}{\sqrt{[N{\sum}x^2-({\sum}x)^2][N{\sum}y^2-({\sum}y)^2]}}
\end{equation}
$$

Where:

N: number of pairs of scores
${\sum}xy$: sum of the products of paired scores
${\sum}x$: sum of x scores
${\sum}y$: sum of y scores
${\sum}x^2$: sum of squared x scores
${\sum}y^2$: sum of squared y scores
