The pronunciations of the most common mathematical expressions are given in the list below. In general, the shortest versions are preferred (unless greater precision is necessary).

## 1. Logic
|EXPR. | PRON. |
|---------|--------------|
|$\exists$  | there exists |
|$\forall$ | for all|
|$p \Rightarrow q$ | $p$ implies $q$ / if $p$, then $q$ |
|$p \Leftrightarrow q$ | $p$ if and only if $q$ /  $p$ is equivalent to $q$ / $p$ and $q$ are equivalent |

## 2. Sets
|EXPR. | PRON. |
|---------|--------------|
|$x \in A$ | $x$ belongs to $A$ / $x$ is an element (or a member) of $A$|
|$x \notin A$ | $x$ does not belong to $A$ / $x$ is not an element (or a member) of $A$ |
|$A \subset B$ | $A$ is contained in $B$ / $A$ is a subset of $B$ |
|$A \supset B$ | $A$ contains $B$ / $B$ is a subset of $A$ |
|$A \cap B$ | $A$ cap $B$ / $A$ meet $B$ / $A$ intersection $B$ |
|$A \cup B$ | $A$ cup $B$ / $A$ join $B$ / $A$ union $B$ |
|$A \setminus B$ | $A$ minus $B$ / the difference between $A$ and $B$ |
|$A \times B$ | $A$ cross $B$ / the cartesian product of $A$ and $B$ |
