Individual mathematicians often have their own way of pronouncing mathematical expressions and in many cases there is no generally accepted "correct" pronunciation.

Distinctions made in writing are often not made explicit in speech; thus the sounds $fx$ may be interpreted as any of: $fx$, $f(x)$, $f_x$ , $FX$, $\overline{FX}$,$\overrightarrow{FX}$. The difference is usually made clear by the context; it is only when confusion may occur, or where he/she wishes to emphasise the point, that the mathematician will use the longer forms: $f$ multiplied by $x$, the function $f$ of $x$, $f$ subscript $x$, line $FX$, the length of the segment $FX$, vector $FX$.

Similarly, a mathematician is unlikely to make any distinction in speech (except sometimes a difference in intonation or length of pauses) between pairs such as the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
x+(y+z) {\rm and} (x+y)+z \\
\sqrt{ax}+b {\rm and} \sqrt{ax+b} \\
a^{n} - 1 {\rm and} a^{n-1} \\
\end{equation}
$$
